Common git commands (typically done in this order):

To start work... with everything in sync with others:

git pull origin main  <--- pull everything down to make sure you're in synce

Now make changes... then move changes through to github.  

git status   <--- review before taking action
git add -A   <--- to add the changed files
git status   <--- new file would now be in git, but not committed  

  Might stay in this state for several changes
  When ready to make the changes trackable with these commands

git commit -m "Comment- make it something meaningful"
git status   <--- review where you're at in the process
git push origin main  <--- should push all the commits to github
