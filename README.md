Common git commands (typically done in this order):

To start work... sync your local repository with repository in github:

**git pull origin main**  Note: pull changes down from github to make sure you're in sync

Now make changes... then move changes through to github.<br />

**git status**   Note: review before taking action<br />
**git add -A**   Note: to add the changed files<br />
**git status**   Note: new file would now be in git staging area , but not committed<br />

Might stay in this state for several changes<br />
When ready to make the changes trackable with these commands<br />

**git commit -m "Comment: but not too long"**<br />
**git status**   Note: review where you're at in the process<br />
**git push origin main**  Note: push all the commits to github each day<br />
